This program is a class scheduler meant for all students at a community college.
Students add themselves to the console by adding their name, student ID, and major.
Students are all able to view the classes required for their major and can query
the next class they must take to complete their major. Students can enroll in classes
they have completed the prerequesites for by adding them to their planner. If they have time
conflicts with a class they are trying to enroll in, and one that is already in their
schedule, the student won't be able to enroll. If a student either drops a class or finishes,
it will be removed from their planner. Students can add themselves to the waitlist of full 
classes, which will allow them to enter the class depending on the professor, and whether 
other students decide to drop the class.
